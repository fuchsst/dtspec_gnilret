# This file was automatically generated by `dtspec init` and typically does not need to be
# modified.  The dtspec cli will parse all .yml files in this directory and subdirectories to
# create the specs.  You may organize your spec files in any way that you desire. One pattern
# would be to create a single file for each target (dbt model), which could usually be described
# with a single scenario.  Then put all of the sources and identifiers in different files.
# For example:
# ├── dtspec
#     ├── main.yml
#     ├── identifiers.yml
#     ├── factories.yml # for factories shared across many scenarios
#     ├── sources
#     |   └── raw.yml
#     └── marts
#         └── core
#             ├── fct_orders.yml
#             └── dim_customers.yml
